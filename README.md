# Catch of the Day
Catch of the Day is a ReactJS app I built following an excellent Wes Bos tutorial. 

The app is designed to allow a user to log into their account, add and remove fresh fish to their order, and have their data instantly updated across the app as well as in the database.

The app allowed me to practise React, Firebase and authentication as well as some CSS animation.
